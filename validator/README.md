# validator

ComputeHorde Validator. See repositories main README for explanation of what that means.

Skeleton of this project was generated with `cookiecutter-rt-django`, which sometimes gets upgrades that are easy to retrofit into already older projects.

# Base requirements

- docker
- docker-compose
- python 3.11
- [pdm](https://pdm-project.org)
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes)

# Setup development environment

```sh
# 1st tab
$ ./setup-dev.sh
```

```sh
# 2nd tab
docker-compose up
```

```sh
# 1st tab
cd app/src
pdm run manage.py wait_for_database --timeout 10
pdm run manage.py migrate
```

Typically, when developing validator, you want to test:

1. Scheduling synthetic jobs
2. Settings weights
3. Passing organic jobs from a facilitator to a miner

Some of these actions may require launching celery locally, which you can achieve by running [start_celery.sh](dev_env_setup%2Fstart_celery.sh).

Some tests start celery in order to test obscure interprocess timeouts. That is generally automated, however celery 
workers being killed on MacOS yield an insufferable amount of error dialogs displayed on top of everything you have 
open. To save developers from suffering this fate, tests support running celery on a remote host, via ssh. A common case
would be a local VM, also running postgres and redis. In such a case, make sure postgres and redis ports are forwarded
so they are accessible from the host, which runs your code/tests. To make tests start celery on the remote host, define
the following env vars (the author of this note suggests using direnv or PyCharm Run/Debug configuration templates for
ease):

```shell
REMOTE_HOST=ubuntu-dev  # ssh config entry name
REMOTE_VENV=/path/to/remote/venv  # on the remote
REMOTE_CELERY_START_SCRIPT=/project/mount/ComputeHorde/validator/dev_env_setup/start_celery.sh  #  adjust the beginning
# to match your synced folders configuration
```

## Scheduling synthetic jobs

```shell
DEBUG_MINER_KEY=... python manage.py debug_run_synthetic_jobs
```

## Setting up a trusted miner for cross-validation

### Set up a server

Create an Ubuntu server and use the `install_miner.sh` script from the root of this repository to install the miner in a **local mode**:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://github.com/backend-developers-ltd/ComputeHorde/raw/master/install_miner.sh | bash -s - local SSH_DESTINATION VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY MINER_PORT DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_CLASS
```

Replace the placeholders in the command above:
- SSH_DESTINATION: your server's connection info (i.e. `username@1.2.3.4`)
- VALIDATOR_PUBLIC_KEY: the public key of your validator
- MINER_PORT (optional): the port on which the miner will listen for incoming connections (default is 8000)
- DEFAULT_EXECUTOR_CLASS (optional): specify a custom executor class to use; **to support A6000 synthetic job flow, setting `always_on.llm.a6000` is mandatory** 

### Provision S3 buckets for prompts and answers

Trusted miners require S3 buckets to store prompts and answers. To provision these buckets conveniently with the correct permissions pre-configured, make sure you have [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed and configured.
Then run the following script:

```sh
curl -sSfL https://github.com/backend-developers-ltd/ComputeHorde/raw/master/validator/provision_s3.sh | bash -s - PROMPTS_BUCKET ANSWERS_BUCKET --create-user
```

Replace `PROMPTS_BUCKET` and `ANSWERS_BUCKET` with the names of the S3 buckets you want to use for prompts and answers respectively. It will automatically create a dedicated user, assign permissions policy for created buckets, and add an access key, displaying it at the end so it can be copied to the validator env file. If you don't want to create a user and prefer to handle permissions manually, just skip the `--create-user` option.

At the end of the script, it will show the values for `S3_BUCKET_NAME_PROMPTS`, `S3_BUCKET_NAME_ANSWERS`.
If you used `--create-user` flag, it will also show the values for `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
You have to copy these variables in your validator `.env` file and restart your validator.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you did not use `--create-user`, you still need to provide `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` in your validator .env file.
> In that case, you will have to manually generate the credentials.

### Updated validator .env

Add or update these variables in the validator `.env` file:

```
TRUSTED_MINER_KEY = "HOTKEY"
TRUSTED_MINER_ADDRESS = "MINER_IP"
TRUSTED_MINER_PORT = MINER_PORT
```
