ComputeHorde SDK documentation
###############################

The **ComputeHorde SDK** enables Bittensor subnet owners to improve the quality of their subnets
by providing validators with cost-effective, scalable compute resources.
Instead of requiring validators to maintain their own physical GPUs,
ComputeHorde offers on-demand decentralized access to trustworthy hardware,
reducing costs and increasing validation power.
